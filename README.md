## Workflows
Structured approaches for different development phases:

* planning.md - Technical planning, TDD strategy, package analysis, and user approval requirements.
* execution.md (coming soon) - Strict TDD implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), bug investigation, zero tolerance for failing tests.
* management.md (coming soon) - Process improvement workflow for _ai.dev directory only, evolving workflows/protocols without modifying project code.
* research.md (coming soon) - Web-enabled investigation with structured capture of findings under _ai/research/.
* qa.md (coming soon) - Quality verification using 3-question framework (objectives, functionality, quality), mandatory CI verification.

## Agents
* code-reviewer.md (coming soon) - Performs reviews on code quality and structure.
